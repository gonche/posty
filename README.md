# Opinionated Laravel Template

This is a template I use when starting a new Laravel project. It is opinionated and uses the conventions I prefer to work with day-in, day-out.

## Installation

You can create a new project via composer:

```bash
composer create-project lukeraymonddowning/laravel-template
```

## Toolset

The created application is configured with the following tools:

- Pest PHP
- Pest Parallel
- PHP CS Fixer
- LaraStan
